Interview CSS question
1.how to add comments on css?
To comment in CSS, simply place your plain text inside  /* */  this is used for multi line comment  and // is single line comment.
Code that is commented out is not used to style the page

2.Why do we use pseudo-class?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. For example, it can be used to: Style an element when a user mouses over it.like :hover , focus .

3. How is specificity applied?
If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.
Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declarations are ultimately applied to an element.

4.What method allows an element to be moved from its current position?

The translate() method moves an element from its current position (according to the parameters given for the X-axis and the Y-axis).
You can use two values top and left along with the position property to move an HTML element anywhere in the HTML document.

Move Left - Use a negative value for left.
Move Right - Use a positive value for left.
Move Up - Use a negative value for top.
Move Down - Use a positive value for top.

 5.what properties does flex model have?
 
The flex CSS shorthand property is the combination of flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis property. It is used to set the length of flexible items. The flex property is much more responsive and mobile-friendly. It is easy to position child elements and the main container.

6.What is the difference between flex and grids?

Flexbox is made for one-dimensional layouts, and the Grid is made for two-dimensional layouts
This means Flexbox can work on either row or columns at a time, but Grids can work on both. Flexbox, gives you more flexibility while working on either element (row or column).
The main difference between the Flexbox and Grid layout is that Flexbox creates content-first design while Grid creates layout-first design.

7.Give an example where we have to use grids and where you have to use flexbox?

CSS Grid and Flexbox are layout models that share similarities and can be used together. The key difference is that CSS Grid can be used to create two-dimensional layouts, while Flexbox can only be used to create one-dimensional layouts.
Use a grid when you already have the layout structure in mind, and flex when you just want everything to fit.


8..Give an example where you cannot use flexbox, and you can only use grids?

If you are using flexbox and find yourself disabling some of the flexibility, you probably need to use CSS Grid Layout. An example would be if you are setting a percentage width on a flex item to make it line up with other items in a row above.
In that case, a grid is likely to be a better choice.

9.What are combinators? give examples of how you can use them

A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors. A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
The final selectors we will look at are called combinators, because they combine other selectors in a way that gives them a useful relationship to each other and the location of content in the document.
 
10.What does object-fit do?
The object-fit CSS property sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video> , should be resized to fit its container. You can alter the alignment of the replaced element's content object within the element's box using the object-position property.


11.What does rotate do?

CSS rotate() Function. The CSS rotate() function is used to rotate elements in a two-dimensional space. The rotate() function rotates an element based on the angle 
that you provide as an argument. You can provide the angle using any valid CSS angle value (i.e. in degrees, gradians, radians, or turns).

12.What rule can be used to define animations?

The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code. The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another. During the animation, you can change the set of CSS styles many times.

13. When working with attribute selectors, how can you select elements which contain a particular attribute value?
The [attribute|="value"] selector is used to select elements with the specified attribute, whose value can be exactly the specified value, or the specified value followed by a hyphen (-).

14.What does @media do?

The @media CSS at-rule can be used to apply part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more media queries. With it, you specify a media query and a block of CSS to apply to the document if and only if the media query matches the device on which the content is being used.

15.What can be used to override properties of an element?

To override the CSS properties of a class using another class, we can use the ! important directive. In CSS, ! important means “this is important”, and the property:value pair that has this directive is always applied even if the other element has higher specificity.

16.How can you select every alternate element in a list of elements using css?
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

17.What is the ranking of selectors with respect to specificity?

Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. If two selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins. There are four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given selector: inline styles, IDs, classes, attributes, and elements.

18.how can we apply the same styles to multiple selectors?

CSS allows you to group multiple selectors that share the same declaration. This optimization technique allows you to apply the same style to multiple elements to save space. You can combine grouped selectors with contextual and other selectors to create powerful yet compact rules for your style sheets.

19..What are the differences between position: 

relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it, whereas position: absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.
